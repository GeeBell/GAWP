Gridcoin is an open source blockchain algorithm that rewards people for offering their Idle Processing Potential (IPP) to data driven analysis and scientific discovery through a distributed computing network.  The Gridcoin Network monitors IPP contributions and rewards participants through the Gridcoin Blockchain.  Reward is distributed in the form of the blockchain incentive, GRC, and is earned through Proof of Stake participation and participation in the distributed computing infrastructure, BOINC.  BOINC, the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing, hosts major citizen escience computing projects such as IBMâ€™s World Community Grid, SETI, and the LHC, alongside projects developed by students, enthusiasts, mathematicians, researchers, and citizen scientists.
