Currently, Gridcoin is developed through an open source submission process.  Any individual or entity wishing to contribute to the codebase can submit changes to the Gridcoin-Research github.  If the proposed changes constitute a major change in Gridcoin protocols, operation, or codebase, a client run poll will likely be required before any changes are implemented.  It is possible that Gridcoin might grow to utilize the open source node structure defined with Bitcoin for accepting updates and improvements to the Gridcoin codebase.
