The Gridcoin blockchain rewards users offering their IPP to approved projects hosted on BOINC, the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing.  BOINC is an open source distributed computing infrastructure which provides anyone with a means to host data to be processed.  Developed out of the SETI project in 2002, BOINC has been used to identify pulsars, create patient specific cancer treatments, expand on our knowledge of efficient molecular combinations for solar panels, and has completed countless other scientific and mathematical computational tasks.  While BOINC has been used primarily for science and math, it can host data from any field so long as the data can be formatted for BOINC’s processes.  Examples of projects include tasks on engineering, rendering, weather and climate prediction, and social, market, and resource analytics.  Any endeavor with the appropriately formatted data to process and a server on which it can be hosted can use BOINC’s processes.
